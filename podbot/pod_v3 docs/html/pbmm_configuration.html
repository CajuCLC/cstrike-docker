   <li><a name="I"></a>Settings in podbot.cfg file
	<span>
   <p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_minbotskill</font> (value) - Sets the minimum Skill if Bots are created without
	specifying the Skill. Correct values are 1-100. Default is 95. <p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_maxbotskill</font> (value) - Sets the maximum Skill if Bots are created without
	specifying the Skill. Must be bigger than minbotskill (or at least equal) of course ! Correct values are minbotskill-100. 
	Default is 100.<p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_minbots</font> (value) - configure the minimum number of bots that will run
	on the server. Default is 0.</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_maxbots</font> (value) - configure the maximum number:<br>
	a) of bots + humans (if pb_bot_quota_match is 0) <br>
	b) of bots (if pb_bot_quota_match is grater than 0)<br>
	that will be possible to run on the server (so it doesn't mean it will automatically add any bot to the server). Default is 16.</p>

	<p>If You don't specify pb_minbots/pb_maxbots (You will comment them out in Your podbot.cfg) then the function 
	auto/add kick bot (described a bit below) will not work (if pb_maxbots is not assigned in podbot.cfg, then the default 
	is 0 for it). If You specify them - then they will support a minimum and maximum number of bots running on the server. 
	Bots can be added to the server (by pb add, pb fillserver commands or by pb_bot_quota_match function) until the total number
	of bots and humans (pb_bot_quota_match = 0) or bots (pb_bot_quota_match > 0) reaches the pb_maxbots value.
	If pb_bot_quota_match = 0 - each time a new player joins the server, a bot will be kicked from the server unless there are only 
	pb_minbots number of bots currently on the server;  after a player disconnects from the server, bot will
	be automatically added back to the server until the total number of players (bots + humans) reaches pb_maxbots again.
	You should make pb_maxbots be AT LEAST one less than the mp_maxplayers value (otherwise no one will be able
	to join your server). Some more explanation to this function You can find <a href="./pbmm.html">here.</a>
	That function auto add/kick doesn't work in the case if pb_bot_quota_match is defined as grater than 0 (in that case
	number of bots follows the number of humans multiplied by pb_bot_quota_match (of course in the range between
	pb_minbots/pb_maxbots). More info read below.</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_bot_quota_match</font> (value) - configure the number of bots that will match
	humans on the server (number_of_bots = number_of_humans * pb_bot_quota_match). In this case number of bots will be limited
	by pb_minbots and pb_maxbots settings. For that function pb_maxbots keeps the max limit of bots on the server (not max 
	number of bots + humans like it's for auto add/kick bot function - when pb_bot_quota_match is 0).
	The work of the function matching humans is stopped by usage some of these functions - pb fillserver or pb removebots. 
	In both cases pb_bot_quota_match will be set to 0. If pb_bot_quota_match is grater than 0, You cannot use commands
	pb add and pb remove (because of the reason the amount of bots must match humans...). Default is 0 (bots don't match humans).</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_bot_join_team</font> (string) - forces joining the bots to specified team (T or CT)
	to overwrite the setting of the command pb add or pb fillserver. Useful if You want to keep always bots in one team against
	humans in the other. Possible value of argument - "T", "CT", ANY". Default is "ANY" (bots aren't forced to join any
	specific team.</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_skin</font> (value) - forces the bots to use the specified skin 
	and to overwrite the skin setting of the command pb add or pb fillserver. 
	Useful if You want to have always bots in one team with the same skin. Argument values: 1,2,3,4 - they are forced skins,
	0,5 - default - no forcing</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_ffa</font> (1|0) - swiches to on the Free For All mode (bots will kill also their teamnates).
	Default is 0 (off)</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_chat</font> (1|0) - Turns on/off Botchatting. Bots chat if they killed
	someone, if the Bomb was planted or if they are dead and bored. Default is on (1).<p>
	<P class="style_note">NOTE:</p>
	<p>botchat.txt file must be in addons/podbot directory even if Botchat is turned off !</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_radio</font> (1|0) - Turns on/off radio usage. It affects also bots reaction to 
	the radio command the human-players may issue. Default is on (1).</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_latencybot</font> [0|1|2] - Switches to on/off (1/0) showing on the scoreboard the string "BOT" 
	as a ping or shows a fluctuating fake ping (from the range 30-50) for bots (2). 0 and 1 are valid only for the bots they are 
	already created - it doesn't affect those in-game ones. Default is 2.</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_jasonmode</font> (1|0) - Turns on/off Jason Mode ! Meaning Bots don't buy
	weapons and only use the knife for combat ! Greets to Auxois ! Use this for much fun with e.a. cs_estate 
	or cs_office . Default is off (0). </p>
	
	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_wptfolder</font> (folder) - Sets the default Folder for loading/saving Waypoint
	Files. This folder HAS to be inside the POD-Bot Directory ! Don't put it into quotation marks and
	don't use spaces or a trailing backslash ! Default folder - wptdefault </p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_detailnames</font> (0|1|2|3) - Turns on/off the Skilldisplay behind names and the
	personality ( [POD], [P*D], [P0D] ) before the name. 0 - no skill sufix and no personality prefix displayed; 1 - the skill
	as sufix and the personality prefix added to the bot's name; 2 - only the personality prefix is added to the name;
	3 - only the skill sufix is added to the new created bot. Default is prefix and sufix diplayed near the name of the bot added (1).</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_numfollowuser</font> (number) - Sets the maximum number of Bots in the team to
	follow the same user (when Radio Command "Follow Me" is used). Default is 3.</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_maxweaponpickup</font> (number) - Sets the maximum number of weapons Bots are
	allowed to pickup during a round. If You don't want to limit bots with pickuping weapons (for example while playing 
	CSDM or fy_ maps) You can use "-1" value. Default is 10.</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_shootthruwalls</font> (1|0) - This cvar specifies if Bots are allowed to

	Default is on (1).</p>
 
	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_mapstartbotdelay</font> (value) - Delay (in seconds) of bots joining after new 
	map start to prevent kick some human-players at map change. Default is 5.</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_firsthumanrestart</font> (1|0) - Turns on/off the function - when the first human 
	joins the server and there are some bots already playing there - the round is restarted. Default is (0).</p>
  
	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_maxcamptime</font> (value) - It says how many maximum seconds the bot may stay 
	camping in one place before going somewhere else. Default is 30 (s)</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_autokill</font> (1|0) - Turns on/off auto killing bots if all human players
	are dead already. Default is off (0).</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_autokilldelay</font> (value) - Delay (in seconds) autokilling bots if
	autokill is enabled. Default is 45.</p><br>

	<font class="style_note">NOTE: </font><br>
	These 3 settings below seriously affects the Bots Perception.<br>
	They specify the rate (in seconds) of updating some of the Bot Checks like:
	some sound, some possibility of pickup any item or usage grenade by bots.
	If you've got a slow computer you could try changing these to higher values to get some 
	performance back.If you've got a fast computer you might try lowering them to get better even better playing 
	results.<br>

	<font class="style_pb_commands">pb_timer_sound</font> (value) - Default is 1.0 (in seconds).<br>
	<font class="style_pb_commands">pb_timer_pickup</font> (value) - Default is 0.3 (in seconds).<br>
	<font class="style_pb_commands">pb_timer_grenade</font> (value) - Default is 0.5 (in seconds).<br><br>


	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_welcomemsgs</font> (1|0) - Lets You to enable/disable some welcome messages, 
	if You would like for example the people don't know there are some bots on the server. 
	Default is on (1).</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_dangerfactor</font> (value) - The setting here specifies the danger 
	factor with which the bots will weighten any waypoint where they have been killed in the past,
	in order to avoid it later. The higher the value, the more the bot will care about these 
	waypoints and pick other routes instead. Progression is logarithmic. Warning: higher values 
	requires more CPU. Default is 2000.</p><br>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb add</font> [skill [personality [team [model [name]]]]]</p>
	<p>This command adds a Bot with parameters - skill You can write from 1 to 100; if You will write 101 it will mean 
	random skill from pb_minbotskili to pb_maxbotskill specified above.<br>
	Personality - 1 to 3 or 5 and these value mean:<br>
	<ul>
	<li>1 - Normal [POD]</li>
	<li>2 - Aggresive [P*D]</li>
	<li>3 - Defensive [P0D]</li>
	<li>5 - Random personality from these 3 above</li>
	</ul><br>
	Team 1 is for Terrorists, 2 for Counter Terrorists and 5 to use auto-assign. This setting might be overwritten by
	forcing bots to join always one team if pb_bot_join_team is equal to "T" or "CT".<br>
	Model (class) is 1-4 or 5 (5 means random from 1 to 4).<br>
	Name is of course the name for this Bot.<br>
	Every command needs to be precedented by "pb" prefix (without quotes).<br>
	If You want to use space in the name of Your bot, You have to use quotes 
	(for example: pb add 100 2 1 4 "James Bond").<br>
	You may not specify some argument without these before (for example - You may not specify bot's name 
	without its skill nor personality nor team nor model - like this: <br>
	pb add Roger<br>
	That abobe is an invalid call of the function adding bot and then some bot with all random parameters 
	(including also the name) will be added to the game.<br>
	You don't need of course specify all parameters - but if You need to specify some of them exactly - all other 
	You have to specify as random. In our example to add some bot with the name Roger You have to write the line:<br>
	<br>
	pb add 101 5 5 5 Roger<br>
	<br>
	and this call of add function is correctly.<br>
	If You want to add some bot to the game with skill 100 to T team, the line should be like this:<br>
	pb add 100 5 1<br>

	In this case the parameters AFTER the latest one You need to specify - aren't important (You don't need write
	anything more). The model will be selected automatically and the name will be choosen from botnames.txt file.<br>
	<p>Some other examples:</p>
	pb add -->skill gets random based on mix\max, all else random<br>
	pb add 50 -->skill is 50 all else random<br>
	pb add 100 1 2 1 "Mr Kabby" -->all have been set<br><br>
	<p class="style_note">NOTE:</p>
	You can use this command only if <font class="style_pb_commands">pb_bot_quota_match</font> is 0.<br><br>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb fillserver</font> [skill [personality [team [model]]]]</p>
	Meaning of the parameters is like for add command. This command lets You fill the server by bots
	until reaching by podbots + human_players(or other bots):<br>
	a) the pb_maxbots value if it is specified (different than 0)<br>
	b) mp_maxplayers if pb_maxbots is not specified (or is equal to 0)<br><br>

	If You want to fill Your server by bots with random skill (between pb_minbotskill and pb_maxbotskill), but as 
	"aggresssive" (and You don't care about their models or team), write this line:<br>
	pb fillserver 101 2<br>
	If You want for example fill the server by bots with skill 100, random personality , random team and 
	random model - write this line:<br>
	pb fillserver 100 <br>
	If You wish to fill the server by bots, but all bots to one team only - then write this:<br>
	a) example for T team and skill 90, all else random:<br>
	pb fillserver 90 5 1<br>
	b) example for CT team and skill and personalities randomly, model 3:<br>
	pb fillserver 101 5 2 3<br>
	The rules are the same for parameters like for add command (except 'name' parameter - 
	for fillserver this parameter doesn't exist).<br><br>
	
	<p class="style_note">NOTE:</p>
	If You want to fill the server by bots to only one team, don't forget set-up game variables 
	<font class="style_server_cvar">mp_autoteambalance</font> and <font class="style_server_cvar">mp_limitteams</font> to 0.<br>
	If You are using <font class="style_pb_commands">pb fillserver</font> command, it changes 
	<font class="style_pb_commands">pb_bot_quota_match</font> to 0 (if it was something else there).<br><br>

	<font class="style_note">VERY IMPORTANT</font><br>
	<p>Since version 3 of podbot the access to podbotmenu is available also on a dedicated server!!!</p><br> 

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_passwordkey</font> (string) - passwordkey - needs set as setinfo on the client's PC 
	to get the access to the main podbot menu. Default is "_pbadminpw"</p><br>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_password</font> (string) - sets the password to let admin control bots on the server throw
	podbotmenu.<br>	
	To get the access to podbotmenu You need to write in Your podbot.cfg (on the server) the line like this:<br>
	pb_password "your_password"<br>
	and also write in autoexec.cfg the setinfo line (at Your client PC in cstrike/czero directory) as:<br>
	setinfo "_pbadminpw" "your_password"<br>
	That setinfo line above can be also typed from the client's console during the game.<br>
	In the above example You may need to write Your-own passwordkey instead default _pbadminpw - if You changed the default 
	setting for it as pb_passwordkey.<br>
	The string was called above as "your_password" it's just Your password You need to write in these both places - 
	in podbot.cfg (near pb_password) on the server and in autoexec.cfg (as setinfo line) on the client's PC.</p><br>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_aim_type</font> (value) - sets the aim type of bots. Available aim type:<br>
	1 = inhuman turns<br>
	2 = constant angle velocity<br>
	3 = botaim1<br>
	4 = botaim2<br>
	Default is 4 (Pierre-Marie Baty's botaim2 enabled).<br><br></p></span></li>
 
	<li><a name="II"></a>Podbot control console commands
	<span>
	<p>You can change all parameters described above from console - if You wish to do this. 
	<p>Except these commands described above there are also some other available commands You can 
	write in console.<br></p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb menu</font> - this command brings up for You the menu to control bots. You can bind it
	(like it's done in default podbot.cfg file existing in package for podbot V3).<br>
	bind "=" "pb menu"<br></p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb help</font> - this command lists all available bot's console commands.
	If You type pb help <command> it will show more precisly help for each command separately, i.e:<br>
	pb help add - it will show all the info about pb add command.</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb killbots</font> - this command kill all pod bots in the game.
	Useful for testing if bots got stuck somewhere becasue of bad waypointing and You want simply 
	finish the round.</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb remove</font> (#bot_id | bot_name) - this command lets You kick 
	the selected bot from the game. bot_id parameter is this what You can see when You type 
	"status" in the console (the same like for standard kick command). bot_name - it's second method
	to specify which bot has to be kicked out (it's like kick by the name).</p><br>
	<p class="style_note">NOTE:</p>
	<p>If Your bot has a space in its name (for example - James Bond) You need to use quotes 
	to successfully usage of the remove command. Example:<br>
	pb remove "[P*D]James Bond (100)"<br>
	Look at this example with attention - if detailnames is on - You have to write also this personality
	prefix and skill sufix - all must be in quotes - because all of this it's the bot's name in this
	example.<br>
	You can use this command only if <font class="style_pb_commands">pb_bot_quota_match</font> is 0.<br><br></p>
	
	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb removebots</font> - this command kicks bots from Your server until 
	reaching pb_minbots. If pb_minbots is 0 then all bots will be kicked out by this command.</p><br>
	<p class="style_note">NOTE:</p>
	If You are using <font class="style_pb_commands">pb removebots</font> command, it changes 
	<font class="style_pb_commands">pb_bot_quota_match</font> to 0 (if it was something else there).<br><br>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb weaponmode</font> (value) - correct value are 1 to 7. This command lets
	You select the weapon will be used by bots only (they will not buy another type).
  	<span>
    	1 - Knife only (JasonMode!)<br>
  		2 - Pistols<br>
  		3 - Shotguns<br>
  		4 - Machine Guns<br>
  		5 - Rifles<br>
  		6 - Sniper Weapons<br>
  		7 - All Weapons (Standard)<br>
		</span>
	</p><br>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_aim_deviation_y</font> (value) - VERTICAL (up/down) error margin of 
	the aiming system. This value affects how far (in game length units) the bot will allow its crosshair

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_aim_offset_delay</font> (value) - Maximal value in seconds after which the 
	aiming system will re-evaluate its ideal direction. This affects how often a bot will attempt to correct an
	imprecise crosshair placement by moving the crosshair inside the error margin bounds defined by the 
	botaim_deviation CVARs. (default: 1.2)</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_aim_notarget_slowdown_ratio</font> (value) - Fraction of the full speed the 
	aiming system will adopt as speed when aiming at nothing in particular. This affects how slow the bot 
	will move its crosshair when targeting nobody, relatively to its full speed capacity. (default: 0.5)</p>

	<p><font class="style_pb_commands">pb_aim_target_anticipation_ratio</font> (value) - Fraction of the estimated

	<li><a name="IV"></a>Weapon/equipment restrictions settings
   <span>
	<font class="style_note">Note:</font>
	<p>This feature has been requested long time ago at BU forum by the people using AMX/AMXX/ClanMod
	weapon restriction. The people got frustrated when admin restricted for the players for example awp usgae, but bots 
	still could buy it. Since version V3 it's possible to follow weapon/equipment restrictions done by those fun mods.
	There is a need to rewrite a bit restmenu.sma in AMX/AMXX to get cvar/cvars interface - to follow it in some another 
	sma plugin to give the correct info to podbot mm binary. There is also a possibility to control manually weapons
	availability/restriction. The interface lets You use 2 strings bitwise as "00100..." - 0 means the weapon is available, 
	1 means the weapon is restricted. There are 2 cvars (as strings) defined for restrictions in podbot mm:</p><br>
	<font class="style_pb_commands">pb_restrweapons</font> (default "00000000000000000000000000")<br>
	and<br>
	<font class="style_pb_commands">pb_restrequipammo</font> (default "000000000")<br>
