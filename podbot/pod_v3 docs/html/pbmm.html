	<font class="style_pb_commands">4. Newround</font> - Same as above, but kills every Client including human players.<br>
	<font class="style_pb_commands">5. Fill Server</font> - Fills all free Server Entries with Bots (until reaching max_bots value). 
    After selecting this option you can specify the team or to auto-assign them. If you especially select a team for the Bots the 
	Server Variables &quot; <font class="style_server_cvar">mp_autoteambalance</font>&quot; and 
	&quot; <font class="style_server_cvar">mp_limitteams</font>&quot; will be set to 0 (thus not caring about balancing teams

	all Bots.<br>
	<font class="style_pb_commands">6. Kick Bot</font> - Selecting this option opens the new selection, where You can choose which one
	bot You wish to kick. There are 4 pages (for 32 players). If some slot is free or is used by some human-player or other bot

	 <li><a name="II"></a>FunModes
	<span><p align="left">This was one of the features removed when PODBot was ported to metamod.</p><span></li>

    <li><a name="III"></a>Ordering Bots through Radio Commands
	<span>You can use some of the Radio Commands to get more support from your Bots if Your <font class="style_server_cvar">
   cvar pb_radio</font> is set to 1 in podbot.cfg (default is 1).<br>
  <font class="style_note">NOTE:</font> When you issue a <font class="style_radio_commands">'Follow me</font>' Command Bots won't 
   follow you in 3 cases:</p>
	  <ul>
  	   <li>The Bots have their own will and they issue a &quot;<font class="style_radio_commands">Negative</font>&quot; if they don't 
      want to follow you.</li>
  	   <li>They don't see you.</li>
  	   <li>They see an enemy and engage the target.</li>
	  </ul>

	<p>A <font class="style_terro_red">Terrorist</font> Bot carrying the C4 or picking it up, will also issue a 
     &quot;<font class="style_radio_commands">Follow Me</font>&quot; sometimes to have some assistance with him. 

	They also do some other Radio Commands like &quot;<font class="style_radio_commands">Need Backup</font>&quot;, &quot;
	<font class="style_radio_commands">Enemy down</font>&quot;, &quot; <font class="style_radio_commands">Enemy spotted</font>&quot;, &quot; 
	<font class="style_radio_commands">I'm in Position</font>&quot; (to tell you he's camping) but not very often, otherwise it would 
	surely get on your nerves...</p></span>

	<li><a name="IV"></a>Summary of Bot Reactions to Radio Commands
   <span>
	<ul>
	  <li><font class="style_radio_commands">Follow me</font> - Forces Bots in the near to follow you. You can specify the maximum number 
	  of bots following in the podbot.cfg by the <font class="style_server_cvar">cvar pb_numfollowuser</font> (defaults to 3).</li>
  	  <li><font class="style_radio_commands">Hold this Position</font> - Makes a Bot who's following you, stay a while at that position 
  	  and look around for enemies.</li>
  	  <li><font class="style_radio_commands">Taking Fire, need assistance</font> - Makes all living Bots (not engaged in a Fight) run to
  	  your position to assist you.</li>
  	  <li><font class="style_radio_commands">Need Backup</font> - Basically the same as above, but limited to distance and also 
  	  the Bots use it sometimes to get some support.</li>
  	  <li><font class="style_radio_commands">Storm the Front!</font> - Mighty command! Forces all Bots in the near to rush in the 
  	  direction you're pointing to when using that command. Basically their level of aggression is increased so 
  	  a pathetic frightened Bot could also turn around and flee.</li>
  	  <li><font class="style_radio_commands">Get in position...</font> - Bots in the near will try to take a covered position and stay 
  	  there until they either encounter an enemy, you order them to leave, or they waited too long.</li>
  	  <li><font class="style_radio_commands">Go,go,go</font> - If a Bot follows you, this commands stops him from following. If there 
  	  are other Bots in the near, they will stop camping and going to roam the map again (normally used in combination with
   	&quot;<font class="style_radio_commands">Get in position...</font>&quot;)</li>
  	  <li><font class="style_radio_commands">Team, Fall Back!</font> - Opposite of &quot;<font class="style_radio_commands">
     Storm the Front</font>&quot;. 
  	  Increases Fear and decreases aggression of Bots in the near so that they are more likely to fall back and stay covered 
  	  for a short period.</li>
	</ul></span></li>

	<li><a name="V"></a>Bot Skill differences
	<span>There is a file called botskill.cfg were you can tweak most skill parameters of the bots by editing the file 'botskill.cfg' 
	with any text-editor.<br>
  	Also take a look into 'podbot.cfg' to adjust some more things to your liking...settings for the Bots if you find them too 
  	easy/too hard.<br>
  	First, Bots with low skills will pause/camp longer and more often, Bots with low skills have a bigger surprise time and they
  	shoot slower and are lucky if they hit something..<br>
  	Then there are minor behaviour differences. For example Bots with a skill above 80 use the Knife more often if you're 
  	near them.<br>
  	If you want to get headshots all the time and attack really fast - add some Bots with a skill of 100.</span></li>

	<li><a name="VI"></a>Bot Personalities
	<span>There are 3 different Personalities in POD now, if you have '<font class="style_pb_commands">pb_detailnames</font>' 
   turned on they are shown through the Prefixes like this:<br>
		<ol>
  		<li><font class="style13">[P*D]</font> = <font class="style13">Agressive Bot</font></li>
  		<li><font class="style13">[POD]</font> = <font class="style13">Normal Bot</font></li>
  		<li><font class="style13">[P0D]</font> = <font class="style13">Defensive Bot</font></li>
		</ol>
		<p>These personalities affect bot's buying system, they influent taking the decision about paths (more aggresive bots take 
      shortest paths, normal bots care about the history (danger of the path) and the distance, deffensive bots are taking 
      the most safe paths. You can specify which one type of personlity has to be added to the game by pb add command 
		(or pb fillserver or from podbotmenu) .</span></li>

	<li><a name="VII"></a>BotChats
		<span>The botchats are files which store what the bot can say during the game and when it's spectating.<br>
  	They are located in the podbot\botchats Folder where you installed the Bot.<br>
  	The translated versions (except the German and English ones) don't use the new Text replacements and the dynamic keyword 
  	chat is still in English language.<br>
  	Rename and copy one of these to &quot;botchat.txt&quot; in the main podbot folder to have your localized Bot Talk.</p>
		<p>These translated versions of the Botchat are available:</p>
		 <ul>
  		  <li>BotChat.txt (default english version)</li>
  		  <li>BotChatBulgarian.txt</li>
  		  <li>BotChatCroatian.txt</li>
  		  <li>BotChatCzech.txt</li>
  		  <li>BotChatDanish.txt</li>
  		  <li>BotChatDutch.txt</li>
  		  <li>BotChatEnglish.txt</li>
  		  <li>BotChatFinnish.txt</li>
  		  <li>BotChatFrench.txt</li>

  		  <li>BotChatTurkish.txt</li>
		 </ul></span></li>

	<li><a name="VIII"></a>Auto add/kick bot function
		<span>What do the people want? They want to keep as constant the number of bots+players at the server, but sometimes 
		this was not working correct in old PB2.5 (client connection failed - bot didn't rejoin back) - sometimes this made 
		a server empty. Another people want the same but with the possibility of some manual control of bots on the server 
		(some manual kick, some manual add, some removebots and some fillserver - these function have to be still available). 
		How to solve this?<br>
		Now in code is a variable invisible for user-admin. It's name is g_iPeoBotsKept - this variable defines <B>how many 
		bots+players shuld be still on the server</B>. This name is only here for explaining how this is working now.<br>
		The meaning of pb_maxbots and pb_minbots - these are limits only but with possibility change them from console by:<br>
		pb_maxbots {new_value}<br>
		pb_minbots {new_value}<br>
		The pb_maxbots variable defines <B>how many bots+players</B> will be on the server when You >B< will use pb fillserver</B> 
		command (of course - if there are on the server some sufficient slots for all of them) or add commands (don't get it 
		as the value which would mean automatically the amount of bots and players on the server after writing it - it's not 
		the same as max_botquota from CSBot - it may reach this limit (pb_maxbots), but it must not do it - depands of the 
		server's admin what will he decide during the game).<br>
		The pb_minbots variable defines <B>the minimum number of bots</B> must stay on the server when:<br>
		a) You will call pb removebots command<br>
		b) some of them will be kicked because of joining some people.<br>
		You can define for ecample pb_maxbots as 12 and pb_minbots as 2 and put 8 add commands in podbot.cfg - then g_iPeoBotsKept 
		is calculated (automaticaly) as 8 - for example - because it's incremented every single add command. If You use 
		fillserver - this variable will reach 12 (in our example) - in the case of calling fillserver g_iPeoBotsKept is 
		overwitten by pb_maxbots variable.<br><br>
		<font class="style_note">NOTE:</font><br>
		On listenserver except add commands also the host (the player-LS owner) is calculated (added) to g_iPeoBotsKept.
		So in the case if he has - for example - 8 add commands in his podbot.cfg - g_iPeoBotsKept variable will be 9
		(at start host and 8 bots on the server).<br><br>

		At the first map (server started) the first bots added to the server are from podbot.cfg - these
		added by add commands or fillserver. If there are 4 add commands - first will enter the game these 4 specyfied
		by these commands and after - if there is also a fillserver command - automaticaly will be added some other bots 
		(according to other parameters of the fillserver command, pb_maxbots and other parameters).<br>
		So - You started the game with 8 bots. Then one player is connected and entered the game, then one bot is automaticaly
		kicked. Player is disconnected - bot is automaticaly added. This is checked every frame - if still g_iPeoBotsKept is 
		the same like number of bots+players.<br>
		If You decide manualy add some bot (from pb menu or by pb add command from console) - bot will be added according 
		to this what You specify (if You type pb add 100 2 2 3 "Rocky" - just exactly this bot will be added - not some bot 
		automaticaly). In this case g_iPeoBotsKept variable will be automaticaly incremented by 1. If You decide to kick manually 
		some bot - bot will be kicked. If from pb menu - You can select which one should be kicked from menu (4 pages),
		if from console:<br>
		pb remove #bot_id<br>
		or
		pb remove bot_name<br>
		bot_id means the same like id for standard kick command.<br>
		In this case g_iPeoBotsKept variable will be automaticaly decremented by 1. Of course all here is valid only if You are 
		in range min/max bots You specyfied before.
		If You decide to use fillserver and You have actualy 10 bots+players on the server - bots will be added automaticaly 
		until reaching bots + players = pb_maxbots (in our example 12). In this case g_iPeoBotsKept will be overwritten by 
		pb_maxbots variable (12).<br>
		The same for removebots - If You decide to use this command, bots will be removed from the server until reaching 
		bots + players = min_bots (in our example 2). In this case g_iPeoBotsKept variable will be overwritten by min_bots 
		variable (2). If You will write in console :<br>
		pb_maxbots 6<br>
		it will decrase (if is grater) the g_iPeoBotsKept variable to 6 and some bots will be probably kicked.<br> 
		If You will write in console:<br>
		pb_minbots 7<br>
		it will incrase (if is lower) the g_iPeoBotsKept variable to 7 and some bots will be probably added. This "probably" 
		above is depanding of actual situation on the server - if the number of human-players lets kick or add some bots in these 
		both situations.<br>
		Connecting to the game more human-players than is actually calculated g_iPeoBotsKept will not affect this variable. 
		If You have this variable as 10 and there is 12 human-players - of course You can't kick more bots.<br>
		All here can work automaticaly and there is still some control and possiblity of manual bots management.<br>
		If You want some delay for bots re-join at new map start then write in console this line:<br>
		pb_mapstartbotdelay 10<br>
		and bot will be joined on the new map after 10s since map start. The same command You can write in podbot.cfg.<br><br>

		If - because of some reason - You don't like this function (auto add/kick bots) You can simply disable it by writting 
		in console:<br>
		pb_maxbots 0<br>
		(or in podbot.cfg file).<br>
		In this case the value of g_iPeoBotsKept will follow the current number of bots + players, but no one bot will
		be automatically added or kicked. Enabling back the function (by typing some different than 0 number for
		pb_maxbots) should change nothing on the server (no one bot should be added or kicked after enabling this function) except
		the situation You specify some pb_maxbots less than current number of bots+players on the server (in this case some of them
		will be kicked until reaching bots+players = max_bots).<br><br>

      You can also keep the number of bots which will match the amount of humans on the server by specyfing pb_bot_quota_match 
      grater than 0 (for example if You want to have 3 bots for each human, You need to write pb_bot_quota_match 3).
      In this case the function auto add/kick bot will not be working and number of bots will be limited only 
      by pb_minbots/pb_maxmaxbots settings and will match humans. To prevent have the server empty it's recommended in this case
      usage pb_minbots grater than 0. The work of the function matching humans on the server is stopped by usage commands
      pb fillserver and pb removebots (both these commands set the value of pb_bot_quota_match to 0).</span></li>

	<li><a name="IX"></a>Known Limitations/Bugs/Problems still present
		<span>Bots sometimes fall from high places<br>
 		Sometimes stuck in other Bots (but should unstuck after less than 5 secs)<br>
 		Sometimes stuck in corners (see above)<br>
 		Counter Bots sometimes fail to detect the bomb (but happens to humans also, so what?)<br>
 		Bots lack advanced teamplay (very basic team-play and affection is present)<br>
 		Bots are too easy to snipe, see above<br>
 		Bots aren't affected by darkness<br>
 		Bots don't drive vehicles, hopefully in the 'Source' engine they will <img src="../smileys/bu_smile.gif"><br>
 		Due to HL Engine Limitations Bots can see through func_illusionaries (e.g. curtains in cs_747, doors in cs_backalley)<br>
 		Bots don't cheat <img src="../smileys/bu_biggrin.gif"></span></li>

	<li><a name="X"></a>Planned for future Releases
