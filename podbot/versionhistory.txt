v2.6 metamod Release 1

+ Ported to Metamod by Pierre-Marie Baty
+ Put all this mess into shape at last (indenting, alignment, comments)
+ Fixed an impressive number of bugs
+ Added support for CS 1.6 (shield code thanks to Wei Mingzhi). Be sure 
  to use the new bot_weapons.cfg file else the bot will crash.
+ Fixed all v2.6 bugs (bomb planting, etc) the way it's meant to be fixed 
  - directly at the spot. No ugly hacks, no "patching".
+ Before I forget: ported to Linux, too
+ Forced the bots to always use the A* pathfinder. It should affect greatly
  the team tactics if used with mature .pxp files.
+ Fixed waypoint 0 with 65535 danger in default experience table
+ Fixed waypoint editor not working anymore
+ Added Austin's super-kickass waypoint editor that he wrote with SoUlFaThEr 
  for the now defunct PoXBot. At least this code won't be lost for everyone.
+ Fixed new experience database bug related to incorrect memset usage
+ Got rid of the ugly CVAR parsing for server commands. Using a real dedicated
  server command handler now. No quotes needed anymore in server commands.
+ Fixed brainless CT bots taking the hostages through impossible routes
+ CT bots now pick up abandoned defuse kits (got the idea while reading
  Wei Mingzhi's 	YaPB code - worth a look, he ported all the POD-Bot 
  code to C++)
+ Fixed incorrect danger estimation of waypoint #0 to 65535 the way it's meant 
  to be fixed (diff. between signed int and unsigned short ?? ;-))
+ Fixed bots not coming back after a map change
+ Fixed 2 possible crash bugs thanks to Wei Mingzhi again
+ Fixed incorrect usage of abs() where it should be fabs()
+ Fixed another weapon selection bug
+ Fixed imprecise navigation of waypoints on top of certain ladders
+ I advise you to delete all your previous .pxp files UNLESS they've been used 
  with POD-Bot 2.5 ONLY (and not the buggy 2.6).
+ The overall performance has been restored to what it used to be with 2.5
+ Rewrote the messy CS buy routines in a clean way at last
+ Fixed Count Floyd's experimental A* pathfinder. He was using no heuristic!!!
+ Fixed bots too shy, was linked to the absence of heuristic function. I wrote 
  a square distance heuristic (no sqrt involved. Fast and efficient)
+ Because of an important change in the way the pathfinder behaves, you should 
  delete all your .pxp files again, or use untouched .pxp files 
  from PB 2.5
+ Fixed bots don't buy in CS 1.6 after the first round.
+ Fixed BotSpawnInit() calls zapping the bot's brains several times in a row
+ Fixed bots trying to pick up a new weapon without discarding the shield
+ Fixed VERY COMMON crash bugs in bot chat functions (ThreatTab index > 31)
+ Fixed yet another whole shitload of crash bugs on bad entities (w/ FNullEnt)
+ Got rid of the unused MOTD message catching
+ Bots now know when icons are blinking on their HUD: bomb, defuser, buy zone
+ Delayed bots buying so that they don't buy all in the same frame (lag issue)
+ Fixed bots having trouble at doors. Bot navigate doors perfectly now.
+ Bots pay much more attention to the mission goals now. They don't mess around
  anymore doing idle stuff, they deploy and go to the goal.
+ Fixed bots getting stuck on ladders where a func_breakable would block them
+ Now using ServerActivate() instead of StartFrame() to catch map changes
+ The A* pathfinder should be faster now
+ Took the buying code out of the message queue. WTF was it doing there ???
+ Rewrote team/class selection function: 3 times shorter, twice as efficient.
+ Now the bot is pretty much more stable.
+ Fixed metamod not reloading plugin after map change issue
+ Fixed failing assert() on Linux systems
+ Fixed a good heap of Linux bugs thanks to the feedback from Bots United
+ Fixed WPTDEFAULT directory case issue (now the default waypoint folder is 
  "wptdefault" in lowercase)
+ Added version stamp to the Win32 DLL this way Austin will be happy
+ Miscellaneous minor fixes
+ Another pathname fix for linux. All paths and filenames are now in LOWER CASE
  (that is, no more "BotNames", no more "PODBot", etc.)
+ Fixed skill not displaying after the bot names when DetailNames is turned on.
+ Took the radio code out of the message queue for simplification
+ Fixed bots gazing at the sky or the floor (or generally anywhere but where 
  they should have looked at instead) when camping on non-camp waypoints (well, 
  they MIGHT still face walls but then it'll be that they've HEARD something)
+ Fixed bots moving their gun erratically when camping
+ Repaired bits of the camping code that was for ages broken in POD-bot (here's
  another example of confusion between angles and vectors...)
+ Fixed a stupid bug in my OWN code that was making the bots use the radio less
+ Removed failing assert() for angle overflow at the end of BotThink(). It was 
  mysteriously failing only on Linux, and the angle was clamped just before.
+ Now building the Linux binary with the NDEBUG option. It should fix all the 
  assert() issues on Linux but it still won't tell me why these asserts fail!
+ Fixed usage of a dozen useless variables for showing the waypoint creator 
  at round start where one single variable would have fit for the job
+ Cleaned up the code again some more
+ Rewritten the bot chat code in a much cleaner way (bots use the "say" and 
  "say_team" client commands like humans now).
+ IMPORTANT: added a new knowledge file type for POD-bot: .pvi files. The .pvi
  files will store the bot's waypoint visibility table on disk instead 
  of recalculating it each time a new map starts. These files will be stored 
  in the waypoints folder along with the .pwf and .pxp files. Like the .pxp 
  files, these .pvi files are deletable (in which case they will be 
  re-created).
+ Fixed visibility table failing to reload on some level change situations
+ Moved all the global variables declarations to bot_globals.h and all 
  the definitions to bot_globals.cpp; only header to include now is 
  bot_globals.h
+ Simplified the waypoint editor code part in waypoint.cpp
+ Pathwaypoints are not added anymore if they go through func_illusionaries
+ Simplified some of the utility functions in util.cpp
+ Fixed quite a few potential crash bugs again. Should be rock stable now.
+ Changed the waypoint copyright message back to what it used to be in PB 2.5
+ Fixed bug where bots would clutter together while navigating on ladders
+ Re-arranged some global variables and rewrote parts of bot.cpp for better 
  ANSI C compatibility
+ Fixed very nasty crash bug in IsGroupOfEnemies function
+ Fixed EXTREMELY NASTY crash bug in BotFindItem(), here's what happens when 
  a coder declares variables everywhere but on top of the functions !!!
+ Fixed shitloads of crash causes in the waypoint editor. Now when you edit 
  waypoints, all the bots are frozen. And once you save and exit editing mode, 
  the map restarts in order to recalculate the visibility table.
+ Made the spawn points display a translucent player model in WP editing mode. 
  May help waypointers when they want to put one waypoint at each spawn point.
+ Fixed buying code that was stuffed up in CS 1.5 because of the bots not being
  able to use the same buy shortcuts as real clients.
+ Miscellaneous (very) little fixes in Austin's waypoint editor.
+ Waypoint editor: now displaying INCOMING path connections in brown (according
  to an idea from SoUlFaThEr)
+ Fixed bots taking the hostages only to the last rescue waypoint placed (first 
  waypoint in the linked list). Now the bots take them to the closest one.
+ Added "autopath on/off" command to toggle automatic pathwaypoint creation.
+ Added "autopath setradius N" command to enlarge/shrink the automatic 
  pathwaypoint placement radius.
+ Tweaked the A* pathfinder so that the bots pay more attention to dangerous 
  routes and choose different paths as often as they can
+ Added a console command/podbot.ini file option to tweak the bot's pathfinder:
  "danger_factor" (an explanation is provided in the podbot.cfg file)
+ Removed obsolete "newmap" command.
+ Denied creation of pathwaypoints from any waypoint to itself.
+ VIP bot will now have a "coward" personality by default (no more VIP rushing
  with that ridiculous pistol straight in front of hordes of AK47-armed Ts).
+ Fixed a bug where checking for waypoints validity after modifying them would 
  unfreeze the bots while still in waypoint editing mode.
+ CT bots now react immediately when they receive the "bomb planted" message
+ CT bots don't decide to camp anymore once the bomb has been planted
+ Fixed bug where bots would not pick up the C4 anymore when they see it
+ Terrorist bots now go and pick up a dropped bomb as soon as they receive 
  the dropped bomb message and they see the blinking point on their radar 
  (unless they've been scared off, or another good reason though).
+ Terrorist bots now reevaluate their goal immediately as soon as they receive 
  the message "someone picked up the bomb".
+ Rewritten player collision code, bots should avoid each other a little better
+ Tweaked some timers so that bots should camp a bit less now.
+ Fixed bug where bots would not alternate their camp directions.
+ Fixed a bug where CT bots could not be added (choosing auto team instead).
+ Waypointers can now type "ap" instead of "autopath".
+ Fixed strafe key bug (thanks Whistler)
+ Fixed potential crash bug by ThreatTab array overflow (thanks Whistler)
+ Bots should not be trying to toss grenades over the walls in de_dust 
  or through the ceilings like in de_nuke anymore.
+ Finally FI-XED wicked bug of bots not able to see through certain types 
  of glass !!!
+ Bots should approach crouched waypoints correctly now (ducking)
+ Bots now estimate crouched waypoints using a slower travel speed while 
  pathfinding (should help them not believe crouched routes are the fastest)
+ Fixed bug where bots would spin around with the head upside down (!!!)
+ Made the waypoint index display cleaner in waypoint editing mode. It doesn't 
  flood the console anymore and it's visible in CS 1.5 and 1.6 identically.
+ Fixed "wp teleport" function in the waypoint editor so that players can't 
  be stuck into the ground anymore when teleporting from one waypoint 
  to another.
+ Fixed incorrect recording of "campstart" and "campangle" angles when adding 
  a waypoint. These values are meant to be ANGLES, NOT vector locations.
+ Added SoUlFaThEr's waypoints for all the default CS maps.
+ Fixed thoroughly all the camping direction code to use ANGLES instead 
  of vectors (campStart and campEnd). ***OLDER WAYPOINTS NEED TO BE 
  RE-CHECKED***
+ Merged Austin's new menu in the WP editor to set the autopath max distance.
+ Fixed crouching wpt getting taller when getting close (to please sPlOrYgOn)
+ Rewrote FL_NOHOSTAGE waypoint handling in a clean way.
+ Merged ThreatTab and Clients array together (they describe the same thing)
+ Cleaned the message queue stuff and insertion/retrieval code
+ IMPORTANT: moved the root directory from "podbot" to "addons/podbot"
+ Fixed another crash bug in StartFrame()
+ Rewritten parts of the ladder handling code in a more efficient way
+ Fixed bug where bots would always hold the "strafe left" key pressed
+ Fixed bug where deleting the last waypoint would crash the waypoint editor
+ Waypoints with the FL_NOHOSTAGE flag show up graphically in the editor when 
  you issue the "waypoint nohostage" or "wp nohostage" command.
+ Displayed all waypoint flags graphically live in the waypoint editor
+ Removed obsolete "waypoint showflags" command.
+ Fixed bots getting stuck trying to look into external camera screens
+ Tweaked some graphics in the waypoint editor
+ Bots now draw the knife to reach high places at jump wpts when necessary
+ Bot's aim don't wiggle anymore now when looking at waypoints with a radius
+ Added recognition of armoury_entities for maps like fy_iceworld
+ Added ability to create/remove multiple pathwaypoints simultaneously
+ Enforced checking for unique bot names during bot creation to avoid doubles
+ Fixed YET ANOTHER crash bug in StartFrame() in the config file parsing code
+ Rewritten completely the config file parsing code: was too messy
+ Rewritten completely the bot spawning code into something readable
+ Rewritten the usage of min_bot and max_bot so that these variables work
+ All the bugfixes submitted by the people on the Bots United forum have been 
  incorporated/committed into the bot code.
+ Completely rewritten the menu display code to make it readable and easily 
  understandable by any third-party source code hackers.
+ Added the ability to point the gun at a waypoint and create/delete incoming 
  and outcoming paths to this waypoint by a single keypress in editing mode
+ Fixed creation of pathwaypoints to the same waypoint bug when jumping
+ Added yes/no confirmation questions to important editing events in 
  the waypoint editor such as save nocheck, or waypoint/pathwaypoint deletion
+ Teleporting player automatically to the faulty waypoint when doing a check 
  on the waypoints and the check fails
+ Rewritten the editor's waypoint beam display code to be more reactive 
  to player movement (now updates every 1/10th second)
+ Added the ability to remember a waypoint and use it later for pathwaypoint 
  creation/deletion. Helps a lot for lifts.
+ Added basic code for elevator/lift usage (see demos on the BU filebase)
+ Added the ability to toggle on/off individually each single waypoint flag
+ Bots don't press buttons randomly now but only where a button flag is set
+ Bots navigate button-controlled doors perfectly, even in groups.
+ Rewritten waypoint stats command to make it display much more information 
  about the waypoints, now displaying each waypoint flag.
+ Rewritten large parts of the memory allocation code. Static memory is used 
  more often and the slow-motion bug has vanished in the process (the problem 
  was that all the bot memory was not correctly freed/was freed twice).
+ Fixed bug where bots would reload way too often, such as after 2 shots.
+ All of the bot config files are now re-read at each start of a new map, 
  so you don't need to restart your server if you make changes in the bot 
  config.
+ The danger directions that the bots learn for each waypoint are now shown 
  using a large red line when waypoints are on (but not when editing them)
+ Bots climbing ladders aim correctly at the top or the bottom of the ladder
+ Bots can now shoot at enemies while navigating ladders. Watch out.
+ Bots navigate elevators quite well, but not easily in groups. The code 
  is here just to show that lifts can work. Feel free to make it work better :)
+ Rewritten parts of the BotDoWaypointNav() and BotHeadTowardWaypoint() 
  funcs so as to integrate the new door code, the button code, ladder and lift 
  code.
+ Bots now draw out the knife when necessary when they do a long jump
+ Simplified a lot of things in the config file parsing code and the chat code 
  to use static arrays instead of dynamically-allocated linked lists whose main 
  purpose seemed to be only to clutter up the code. It's just readable now.
+ Added a "peace mode" feature where bots ignore their enemies. Useful when 
  testing paths with debuggoal in waypoint editing mode.
+ You'll simply love that waypoint editor, lads.


v2.6 metamod Release 2

+ Changed the way all the addbot commands work. Instead of actually adding 
  a bot it'll add it to a bot creation queue.
+ Made APMD apply to adding pathes

+ Menu to choose which team to kick a bot from
+ Fixed "Unnamed" bots.

  them from idioticly running up to an enemy.. No one actually wants to reach 
  the enemy's location while they're shooting at them...) (commented out 
  in the first few lines of BotDoAttackMovement)
+ Initialize msec values in ServerActivate (Supposed to fix slow-mo)
+ Added ability to choose which team to kick a bot from
+ Fixed them from having an extra new line at end of their chatting.
+ Fixed their weapons menu and hopefully all that was messed up with 
  the weapons due to the port to 1.6 (they were buying "restricted" weapons 
  because the configurations and everything was wrong)

  before running ENTINDEX)

  skill level.


V 3.0 metamod Build 15

+ Changed: addbot is replace by add command (the syntax is the same).
+ Added: access to podbot menu when the game is created on dedicated server.
+ Changed: Bots detect friend/enemy according to the TeamInfo messages instead
  checking the model (it should work correctly with such mods as SuperHero, 
  ChickenMod etc). 
  Thanks to T(+)rget (AMX), Bailopan (AMX MOD X) and THE_STORM.
+ Added: support for compatibility with weapon restriction management done 
  by fan mods (as AMX, AMX X, AdminMod, ClanMod) - if weapon is restricted for 
  human-players - bots will not buy that item neither :)
+ FIXED: bug in auto add / kick bot function (when there were some players 
  on the server before adding bots - first bot got kicked instantly after 
  adding it).
+ FIXED: Bots are spawned with cleared correctly every data (before they were 
  cleared only at round start, but to support CSDM they have to be cleared 
  at every respawn).
+ FIXED: Now bots don't throw nades in jason mode.
+ Changed: the task system - the tasks aren't still placed on the task's stack 
  over and over again - instead this only one task of each kind may be placed 
  on the tasks' stack (and priorities are tested by a separate function).
+ FIXED: Bots don't look at the wall all the time (if last enemy is far away 
  - they forget it much more now - so they don't look at the wall in the last 
  enemy direction.
+ Changed: Bots look around more often now.
+ FIXED: Bots don't spray anymore since spraying is disabled.
+ FIXED: Bots unzoom (while using weapon with zoom) if they don't look far away
  or they look at the wall near of them.
+ Changed: Bots should jump a bit less if they "think" they stuck.
+ FIXED: Bots should hear everything around good again.
+ FIXED: Crash with server commands (thanks to KRoT@L - AMX).
+ Changed: the work of add bot and kick bot menu (after adding one or kicking 
  one You can still continue adding / kicking bots without necessity to re-open
  the main podbot menu).
+ Changed: After blinding bots don't shoot everytime at last enemy position 
  (it's randomized now).
+ Changed: the usage of nades by bots - bots are trying to throw flashbangs 
  into corridors; whole nades should be thrown more precise now.
+ Changed: Better team playing (they use "follow me" function and they follow 
  all condition included in path they walk (according to flags in waypoints 
  they pass - for example jumps).
+ Changed: Bots don't buy primary weapons on aim_xxx, awp_xxx maps.
+ Changed: the skills of bots are now much different - there is realy apparent 
  difference between bot with skill (100) and bot (80).
+ Changed a bit the usage of statistic/experience (to better usage by A* 
  function).
+ FIXED: bots don't reply on chats.
+ FIXED: Bot stayed as spectators instead joining the team after 08.2005 Steam 
  update.

+ Added variable to delay bots' re-join on the new map start (mapstartbotdelay)
+ Lift code rewritten - watch 2 new demos in filebase.
+ Added autokill function (cvars pb_autokill 1|0 and pb_autokilldelay time_sec)
  - it will kill bots (if pb_autokill is set to 1) automatically if there are 
  some human players on the server, but all of them got already killed. But if 
  the bomb is planted and there is no more alive human-players - the auto kill 
  doesn't kill bots in this situation.
+ Optimized code to have lower CPU usage.
+ FIXED - bots shouldn't steal anymore Your hostages You are trying to rescue 
  (after pressing "use" button).
+ Bots don't try to go to the rescue point if they don't have already a hostage
  (hostage got killed or some human-player stoled it).
+ Added - bots wait until the hostages they follow it are rescued (they reach 
  the rescue point) - it means if You place in a wrong place a WP with Rescue 
  flag (not in the Rescue Zone) - the bot will wait there forever - because 
  they will be never rescued (thanks to Ancient showing the bug).
+ FIXED burst mode in low distances to enemies.
+ FIXED the problem with weapon_strip entity (thanks to strelomet).
+ Changed and improved nades throwing - bots should aim better the position 
  they want to throw the nade (the old calculation of the place the bot should 
  look at during nade throwing was a bit strange).
+ Added - to unstuck code "go back" function has been added (to existing jump, 
  strafe, duck).
+ Changed unstuck behavior - improved strafe and go back method in unstuck 
  code. They should try to omit/obey the obstacle (or a bit go back and try 
  again) instead jumping only.
+ Changed the code for players colision detection (they should less jump now 
  and more often use strafe and go back).
+ FIXED - bots don't throw nades now in "ignore enemies" mode.
+ Added 2 new commands (exactly old command with new arguments) for 
  waypointers:
  pb wp teleport use - teleports the waypointer to the next waypoint with 
     the flag USE_BUTTON
  pb wp teleport camp - teleports the waypointer to the next waypoint with 
     the flag CAMP
  These commands are usefull if You are trying to fix old PB2.5 waypoint with 
  old method of camp usage (with pb mm the old camp waypoint is causing to look
  the bot in some strange direction) and also with USE_BUTTON (old PB2.5 was 
  placing that flag on every WP existing near some func_button - it may cause
  sometimes stupid behavior of pb mm bots if they have nothing to "use", but 
  there is placed that flag).
  The old "pb wp teleport wp_nr" is still working like before.
+ FIXED pb_debuggoal - it should work now everytime (before I noticed few 
  situations they didn't want to go to the WP I was requesting them to go).
+ Changed the execution of the task FOLLOW_USER - bots should follow the user 
  this way - they should take some random WP near their user (but connected to 
  the closest one to the user). If they are somewhere near their user, they 
  should look at him (except if there is some enemy nearby) and they should 
  better unstuck if they are close to them-selves (to make a room to go).
+ Changed - if the bot cannot reach its waypoint in some certain time 
  it should've reach it (or bot was doing some unwaypointed movement), during 
  finding the WP near by it checks also the previous WPs and the current WP 
  (for some reason before it wasn't so) and it checks if the new WP isn't in 
  some danger (to fall down) area.
+ Smarter Button flag/Door Button code.
+ Changed Button code - if there is a USE_BUTTON flag - they randomly decide 
  to push or not the button (after first time noticing the WP with that flag; 
  next vistit this WP -> new decision about pushing).
+ FIXED button code - bots shouldn't stay anymore near some button and look 
  infinitely at it.
+ Changed - bots will hunt enemies more often now - normal and agressive ones 
  - if there is the number of alive players in one team more or equal than 
  (2 * alive players) of the other team - they will try to hunt them (for 
  example 2CT alive and 4T alive (or more) - these normal and agressive T bots
  will start to hunt CTs :) ) - of course it depands of the current level 
  of bots fear/agression.
+ Config file podbot.cfg is no longer reloaded on the new map start
+ All config commands are possible to change during the game from console
  by typing "pb command_name [arguments]"
+ All config commands need everywhere the prefix "pb" (on listenserver, on DS 
  and in podbot cfg).
+ FIXED bug apearing on linux servers (auto teleporting bots to (0,0,0) ).
+ FIXED bots changing personality to normal after a change of map.
+ FIXED min_bots and max_bots not working correctly.
+ FIXED TKing bots due to new player models in CZERO.
+ Made the bot's turning more realistic (thanks to Pierre-Marie Baty 
  and Aspirin for botaim and botaim2 plugins).
+ Made them buy grenades more (thanks to bluebyte)
+ FIXED NUM_FOR_EDICT error.
+ FIXED crash on cs_bigbrother_beta1 (related to grenade throwing).
+ FIXED typo in botweapons.cfg
+ FIXED Waypoint Cache not showing right number.
+ FIXED weapon buying screw up when changing weapon modes on a assasination 
  map.
+ Bots will now shoot through teammates if mp_friendlyfire is off.
+ Bots reload more now thanks again to bluebyte :)
+ Bots can now spray logos again.. thanks to g4s for pointing this out.
+ Bots switch to pistols when primary is a sniper rifle.
+ FIXED a crash that would occur when there were experience files for the map
  and you happen to have waypoints on and you walked to waypoint #0 without 
  changing any waypoint data.
+ Automatic Ladder connections now made within Auto-Path Max Distance.
+ New Waypoint Colors..
+ Waypoint that is being pointed at is now ENLARGED and has a little blue thing
  on top of it.
+ Play in cs:cz without the need to modify the source!
+ Improved bots shooting breakables.
+ FIXED bots not taking out the bomb and trying to plant.


V 3.0 metamod Build 16b

+ Changed - Bots shouldn't make bots-towers on ladders anymore (they test all 
  the ladder right now - not only if the current WP is used by another bot 
  - like it was before).
+ Changed - the creation of the visibility table doesn't lag the server 
  anymore.
+ FIXED - the WP editor - now You should more easy and more precisly point 
  the WP You want to manually make the path connection.
+ Fixed problem with hostages (bots ignored them a lot instead pickuping them).
+ Changed the behavior of finding goals (it was too much randomized - almost 
  not related to the current bot "feeling" - now the weight between random and 
  "feel" choice of the goal is changed more to the "feel" - twice more than 
  random). So now they should focus more on the "mission".
+ FIXED another problem with hostages (few times pickuped by a bot the same 
  hostage).
+ FIXED (my) mistake in the waypoint editor - now when You point some waypoint 
  - the manual path connection will be done with that pointing WP. If You have 
  some trouble with pointing a WP - just try to point the middle of its height.
+ Added 2 new cvars requested by Austin: pb_bot_quota_match 
  and pb_bot_join_team. 
+ Added - You can set the debuggoal index from the WP menu from "Options". 
  On the same page You can switch it off.
+ Added the new cvar pb_ffa which swiches to on the Free For All mode (bots 
  will kill also their teamnates). 
+ FIXED problem with throw flashbang at round start at cs_militia.
+ Approved a bit unstuck code at round start (still not perfect yet.
+ FIXED - they should look at the wall less (again).
+ Changed - bots should be harder now (requested by a lot of people).
+ FIXED usage of time frame interval value in the code (to predict the position
  of the enemy in the next frame or so).
+ FIXED and re-written bots hearing stuff (bot are affected by their 
  own-sounds, are affected also by sound of teamnates and also the distance 
  from the source of issued sound to the bot has the influence for this what 
  the bot can hear.
+ BOTS will shoot more often through the wall (because of the fix above).
+ FIXED - for pb_bot_quota_match parameter the spectators or team unnasigned 
  human-players aren't counted.
+ FIXED problem with breakables the bot is trying to pass because 
  the waypointer made the connection through it.
+ Changed - The values of cvars are taken as pointer members now 
  (the addresses-pointers are cached at the initialisation of the vars, then 
  - instead using CVAR_GET_FLOAT (which is taking too much time) there are used
  the values addressed by these pointers to the cvars (main idea taken from 
  AMX MOD X - thanks to BAILOPAN)
+ Changed - Bot should look at the head of the pickuping hostage instead 
  of his stomach...
+ Changed aiming system to make bots harder again
+ FIXED bug with shoving/pushing hostages intead pickup/use them by bots
+ Changed the system of finding bombs by CTs (before they were trying to go 
  to the closests goal WP, then they were choosing randomly another one; 
  currently if they chose some goal WP and they are near it and they cannot 
  hear the bomb, they check some farer away goal WPs - to prevent visit for 
  example 5 goal WPs at the same bomb site if they cannot hear the bomb 
  at that bomb site).
+ Changed - Bots should camp a bit more often instead rush all the time 
  (again).
+ FIXED - Bots aim better the moving target.


V 3.0 metamod Build 16c

+ Changed - Bots should aim better farer away targets.
+ Changed - Bots should better recognize if they can or they cannot hurt 
  their friends while shooting.
+ Changed - Bots should use the knife more often in shorter distances.
+ Changed - Bots should better try to find the bomb to defuse it (CTs).
+ FIXED problem with the lift on as_highrise (the lift with the door) - such 
  lift needs also the special waypointing - example in the BU filebase.
+ Added the new cvar pb_skin which forces the usage by bots the specyfied skin 
  (1..4 - forced skin; 0,5 - no forcing) regardless of "pbb add" 
  or "pb fillserver" parameters.
+ Added support for pickuping weapons created by CSDM 2.x (by BAILOPAN) 
  in item mode.


V 3.0 metamod Build 16f

+ Bots should pickup also "worse" weapons (better/worse - according 
  to the weapon's priorities in botweapons.cfg) if the current "better" weapon 
  is out of bullets.
+ Added support for pickuping ammo, nades, armor, medkit in item mode of CSDM 
  (or on maps fy_xxx)
+ FIXED bug with bots not being able to pickup even "better" secondary weapon.
+ Changed - the entity player_weaponstrip will get as v.target 
  and as v.targetname the value "fake" only if v.target is empty string.
+ They should think a bit less before shooting (which should make them 
  a bit harder again, I hope).
+ Added the possibility to unlimit pickuping weapons by bots 
  - pb_maxweaponpickup = -1
+ Added the code if the bot cannot pickup something (for some reason) during 
  4 seconds - he will mark that entity as ignored (to stop task pickup item).


V 3.0 metamod Build 17

+ The bots shouldn't think now too much before shooting.
+ The algorithm to check if the bot can hurt a friend while shooting should 
  work a bit better.


V 3.0 metamod Build 18

+ Changed - in fireing weapons - they should have really little pauses between 
  shooting. It makes them harder again. 
+ Added the possibility to switch on/off radio command usage and reaction 
  on them (as a side-effect). You can change this setting by pb_radio 0/1.
+ Changed - bots should camp more often if they have some sniper weapon, 
  they shouldn't if they don't have any rifle or any sniper weapon (except 
  they defend for example the planted or dropped bomb or so).
+ FIXED bug with bots not changing the camping direction every few seconds.
+ FIXED bug with bots unable to unstuck for long period time (unstuck code 
  works much better again).
+ Changed - bots should find better the planted bomb according to this what 
  they actually can hear (if in some area the bot cannot hear the bomb 
  - he marks all goal waypoints in that area as "visited" without necessity 
  checking them separately - i wasn't implemented correctly in V3B16a).
+ Changed - bots are more forced to rescue hostages after pickuping them 
  (it happened a lot of times the bot got a hostages, then he was walking 
  around the map instead to go to the rescue point).


V 3.0 metamod Build 18b

+ FIXED bug with bots not planting the bomb (while debugging I saw the bot 
  "thinks" it has mp5navy instead C4 instead in its hands, but it even haven't
  had mp5navy at all).
+ FIXED bug with pb_minbots not working correctly since pb_bot_quota_match 
  has been implemented.
+ Added - the bots hould run better on higher fps PC (some addition to msec 
  code calculation).
+ FIXED - the bots should react on a sound better again (I've noticed a lot 
  of times I was fireing at them and they weren't reacting at all like without 
  hearing me).
+ Added/fixed - the bots should switch to better weapon after hearing the enemy
  nearby (except they are planting/defusing the bomb). Because of that they may
  use nades less often.
+ FIXED - when the bot shoot at the enemy behind the wall, he shouldn't hit him
  the same way as he could hit him while seeing him (for example by one shot 
  into the head). It should be more randomly now.


V 3.0 metamod Build 18c

+ Optimized a bit the code to reduce CPU usage
+ Changed - visibility table is now saved at round end (the first round end 
  after is calculated - instead at map change)


V 3.0 metamod Build 19d

+ FIXED - the bots shouldn't shoot at the exact position of the enemy behind 
  the wall anymore.
+ Changed minimum delays of some weapons (to get them more accurate for longer
  distances).
+ Changed - blinding bots by AMX/AMX X ATAC plugins should affect them better.
+ Changed - the bots should better escape from bombzone (CTs - if they don't 
  have any chance to defuse - too small amount of time; T - about 20sec 
  to explosion; psycho T's don't care)
+ Added - the bots should use the shield much better than before (attackers 
  don't try to loose the whole ammo, defenders - they are trying to cover by 
  it better and shoot with a pistol so often as possible).
+ Optimized the usage of CS messages by using static instead dynamic variables
  (should reduce again the CPU usage).
+ Changed - the bots should use the shield much better than before.
+ FIXED targeting VIP's first by Ts on as_xx maps.
+ Changed - for linux i386 (32 bit) compiled with gcc4.1 (the new crosstool - 
  big thanks to ghost_of_evilspy) - the old library libstdc++5 will not be 
  necessary anymore to load the binary file (podbot_mm_i386.so).
+ Changed - if bots get stuck on ladders with teamnates they should try to go
  to some previous waypoint (near the ladder).
+ FIXED some litte problem with breakables (the bots failed to break 
  a breakable if the path between 2 waypoint across a breakable was longer 
  than 128 units - very rearely bug).
+ Added the new function to the Waypoint Editor - pb wp clean (as the console 
  command only).
  This function cleans up some stupid and unnecessary connections. If there is 
  no argument, it takes as the argument the nearest waypoint and it checks its 
  paths (for example if there are 3 connections - 1 to a farer away WP between 
  2 placed nearby or so). You can also put as an argument the WP index number 
  You want to clean. You can also put the string "all" (without qutes as 
  an argument - pb wp clean all) - it will cleanup all unnecessary connections 
  from the map. I'm using this function to remove bad connections created 
  by some beginner Waypointers (also created by me few years ago).
  Note - sometimes after using this function with argument "all" You can also 
  loose about 1-2% of the connections they were expected (as done correctly), 
  but because of the big advantage in cleaning up the map from bad connections 
  it's really recomended if You want to re-waypoint some map waypointed some 
  time ago by some poor waypointer. It reduces the time to make waypoints from 
  scratch. If You have the map covered correctly by waypoints You need only add
  few waypoints like jumps, camps, Team specific, goals, rescue etc and more 
  than likely You can finish waypointing the map in an hour. If this function 
  will delete some paths they were expected - the WP editor will tell You 
  if there is any broken connection while saving pwf - so You don't need to be 
  afraid of using this new function.
+ Added facing filtering and fixing shaking the bot all the time.
+ FIXED problem with bot towers on ladders (the bot goes away from the ladder 
  and it waits a bit if a teamnate is already using the ladder).
+ Changed WaypointNodeReachable function for adding waypoints and selecting 
  a better alternatives if the waypoint is in use by someone else.
+ Improved omitting the obstacles with strafing (unstuck code).
+ Improved detection if the bot can move forward/back (unstuck).
+ FIXED small problems with collecting experience data.
+ FIXED problem with looking at the strange direction while camping.
+ FIXED small problem with reloading the weapon.
+ Changed - the function WaypointAdd is rewritten a bit to prevent making 
  stupid connections, too, so You can now use more effectively the function 
  AutoWaypointing. All advanced waypointers normally haven't been using it 
  - because of a lot of stupid connection the function WaypointAdd was creating
  (it needed manually clean up all those stupid connections - it was taking too
  much time), but since now You can use it (AutoWaypointing) much frequently 
  to make waypoints for Your favourite maps more effectivelly.
+ Improved aiming at waypoints more accurate now (Waypoint Editor).
+ Changed the info shown for waypoint editor (it shows more info now).
+ Changed the refresh of drawing waypoints (every 0.1 sec separatelly for each 
  waypoint).
+ Changed a bit aiming the target by bots (taken some idea from YapB).
+ Added some commands concerning to experience data:
  pb experience show - shows the data stored in the pxp file
  pb experience test_a_T ind1 ind2 byPathType - shows the path the Terrorist 
  bot would like to choose from WP ind1 to WP ind2 according to kind 
  of algorithm:
    byPathType = 0 - the shortest way according to distances between waypoints 
	                 (used by aggressive bots),
	byPathType = 1 - the shortest way according to distances between waypoints 
	                 and to the collected experience (damages collected - used 
					 by normal bots),
	byPathType = 2 - the shortest way according to collected experience (no 
	                 matter what is the distance between waypoints - used by 
                     the most scaried bots).
  pb experience test_a_CT ind1 ind2 byPathType - shows the path 
  the Counter-Terrorist bot would like to choose from WP ind1 to WP ind2 
  according to explained above byPathType parameter.
  pb experience test_a_CTH ind1 ind2 byPathType - shows the path 
  the Counter-Terrorist bot (with following him a hostage/hostages) 
  would like to choose from WP ind1 to WP ind2 according to explained above 
  byPathType parameter.
+ FIXED some minor bugs with ducking bots.
+ Changed - if the bot is forced to camping at non-camp Waypoint - it is trying
  now to use now the danger direction for that Waypoint instead just pickuping 
  the random visible WP to camp in that direction.
+ Changed - the bots are sometimes also ducking while shooting from other than 
  awp weapon (similar to YapB)
+ Optimized again engine messages usage (thanks ghost_of_evilspy and his 
  jk_botti)
+ Changed the way of checking if custom body parts (arms, legs, feet) are 
  visible for the bot (to stop random part checks - another cause of shaking 
  bots).
+ FIXED bug with jumping bots after camping and after reaching the destination 
  waypoint during the normal navigation movement.
+ Changed the way of calculating the vertical position of landing of 
  the grenade (if the enemy is above or under the bot).

V 3.0 metamod Build 20a

+ Added the invisibility check, so if the player is invisible, the bot cannot 
  see him (at least until invisible player is starting to shoot at him - then 
  - he can see the fire from his gun, so he is trying to answer with fireing 
  at that direction).
+ Added affecting bots by darkness (thanks to PMB and his RACC code) - same 
  like above - if in the dark room the enemy is starting to fire at the bot, 
  so he can see the fire from the enemy\\\'s gun - then the bot is fireing 
  at that direction, too.
+ Expressed the meaning of pb_detailnames cvar (0 - no skill and no [POD] 
  prefix, 1 - skill as sufix and [POD], [P*D] and [P0D] prefixes added to 
  the name; 2 - only the prefix is added to the name (no skill as the sufix
  added); 3 - only the skill sufix is added (no [POD] tags added).
+ Added pb_maxcamptime cvar (default 30) - the maximum time You allow the bot
  camping in one place - after that time it has to go to another place.
+ FIXED problem with reloading the weapon at the round start.
+ Added - if the bot has less money than 900, sometimes they will try to save 
  the money by not buying any new weapon.
+ Changed - reverted back - the bot is taking care about the closest sound 
  instead of the most loud one. The sound is also affecting the bot at least 
  1 second again (to prevent changing aim direction too often when hearing 
  something).
+ FIXED - if there is no enemy nearby and the bot is going to pass the door, 
  the bot is facing the door to open them in the right direction.
+ FIXED - when the bot is turned into the chicken (ChickenMod), it is now able
  to pickup hostages and defuse the bomb.
+ Added more code for Ts to better choose the bombzone (if too many enemies 
  near the closests bomb-spot, the bot is trying to go to another one).
+ Changed - if the bot has more money and already has a primary weapon, he is 
  buying now a better primary weapon. The bot is not droping the higher price
  weapon at the new round start to buy the cheaper one - but in his opinion 
  - better one.
+ Changed - for linux i386.so version - statically linked with libstdcc++6.so 
  - big thanks to THE_STORM for figuring it out.
+ Changed - if the bot is chickened, it is not buying any primary nor secondary
  weapon anymore (the new coming ChickenMod is forcing the player to drop 
  the gun, so no reason to lose money by the bot).
+ Changed the code for CTs to better find the planted bomb. 
+ Added - since the bots are affected by darkness, they have to use 
  flashligths. Thanks THE_STORM and Immortal_BLG for tips.
+ Added more info for wrong waypoints connection "Waypoint problem. No path 
  found" message should also say between which nodes the path is missing).
+ FIXED the bug with radio commands the bots were saying to nobody (if none 
  of teamnates was yet alive).
+ FIXED the bug with pb_mapstartbotdelay (thanks to Orangutanz to point it out)
  and pb_wptfolder cvars not loaded for the first map.
+ Added the new cvar pb_latencybot [0|1] which lets You show one the scoreboard
  the string [BOT] instead nothing. 
  Note - it works only when the bot is adding/creating, so changing the cvar 
  later doesn't affect any bot already in-game.
+ Changed a bit behavior of using flashlights (no longer used while attacking 
  or they can hear the enemy nearby - so they aren't easy target anymore).
+ Addded - Bots are buying and using nightgoogles on dark maps.
+ Changed - the bots are no longer trying to use any weapon except knife if 
  they are zombies.
+ Changed - the bots are trying to hunt/attack the enemies and jump more often 
  if they are chickens/zombies.
+ FIXED problem with TeamInfo messages, so the bots should know better who is 
  a friend and who is an enemy now.
+ FIXED problem with bots jumping while shooting from the sniper weapon.
+ Changed some code with pickup/defuse/attack priorities.
+ Changed - the bots as chicken and zombies are hunting their enemies yet more
  aggressive.
+ FIXED - Bot better uses the zoom (instead zooming in/out all the time) 
  of sniper and assault weapons.
+ FIXED - When the bomb is planted the bots wanted to go to the target using 
  the shortest path (so all of them could get easy get killed by waiting Ts). 
  Now they are getting the path according to the "danger" data experience.
+ FIXED - Bots were trying to get the same waypoint to camping while defending 
  some position (for example the planted bomb).
+ Changed - the bots are trying to hit the enemy behind the obstacle more often
  now (if he could be seen or heard before).
+ Changed - the bots are not trying to spray so much the ammo for the enemy 
  behind the wall (just a little bit and with some interval time (15sec) it may
  happen again).
+ Changed - Filtering the aiming position to don't switch too often 
  the position the bot should look at.
+ FIXED - The bot is switching now to the secondary weapon for short distances 
  to the enemy, when is using the sniper weapon.
+ Changed - The nade throwing - the bot checks where the enemy is looking at 
  (if visible) to prevent to be an easy target (or throws it at near expected 
  enemy's position - if the enemy is behind some obstacle).
+ Changed - Some functions more frequently called are using static variables 
  now, so it should be better optimized in execution now.
+ FIXED problem with bots looking very often at the ceilling.
+ Changed - Forcing CT bots stop camping and trying to defuse the bomb if 
  the defuser got killed.
+ Changed a bit method of checking if the entity to pickup (i.e. bomb) 
  is visble.
+ FIXED - bots unable to find the bomb partially visible (by Ts and CTs).
+ Changed a bit blinded behaviour of the bot.
+ FIXED bots trying to avoid an approching grenade didn't check if they may 
  fall down while moving back.
+ FIXED bots reloading the weapon didn't check if they may fall down while 
  moving back.
+ FIXED - the bot should answer positive for the command "Follow me" only 
  in the case it is really going to follow its "user".
+ Changed a bit the check for throwing grenade direction - it should prevent 
  to throw the nade in weird directions (at least 50% reduced).
+ FIXED - CT bots are finding better the bomb to defuse it if they are nearby.
+ FIXED - bots weren't avoiding the nades throwing in their direction.
+ FIXED - better affecting bots by smoke grenades and flashbangs.
+ Changed - the bots should better aim the new WP while walking (so they should
  faster change the direction to go - better following waypoints).
+ FIXED - "Taking fire, need assistance" command was issued even if the enemy 
  wasn't fireing at the bot.
+ FIXED - the bots shaking and spinning effect (reduced 99%).
+ FIXED - the bots strafing while doing attack movement.
+ FIXED the calculation of the path's length according to the "danger" data 
  experience.
+ FIXED the problem with spinning bot while throwing nades.

V 3.0 metamod Build 21

+ FIXED - problem with CT bots not defusing the bomb sometimes (no anyone 
  nearby and they didn't defuse).
+ FIXED - problem with usage of buttons triggering double door (consisting 
  left and right part like on cs_chemical).
+ Changed - aiming for moving targets.
+ Optimized the code for lookup enemies - it should reduce the CPU usage about 
  30%.
+ Changed - optimized the code for unstuck bots (especially when the bot 
  is stuck with other bots/players).
+ Changed - finding \\\"BestWaypoint\\\" for navigation (if the new WP in path
  is used by another bot/player, the bot will take another WP connected with 
  the previous and next WP only if the next is visible from the prevoius one 
  - that check was prevoiously missing).
+ Reverted back - the check if the heard/last enemy is far away behind any 
  obstacle (to prevent look the bots at the wall).
+ Added - if the bot follows waypoints while walking according to the path 
  and it has to change the direction more than 60 degrees (if it would 
  continue exactly the same direction - the angle would be 0 degrees) and 
  waypoints radius is smaller than 17 then the bot slows down for 0.5 sec 
  and then it continues normal walking. That should prevent the situation 
  when - i.e. - the bot changes the direction 90 degrees and it hits the wall 
  instead the door.
+ FIXED - problem with bots looking wrong direction at walking (in most cases 
  they should look forward, but it may happen they are also looking at danger 
  position - which isn't forward). That should reduce their looking 
  at the wall.
+ FIXED - problem with not updating the global experience if the overflow 
  of experience data was about to happen.
+ Reverted back some function in sound slimulation (the sample of the sound 
  is now also taken in account for 1.2 sec instead of 1 sec; 
  the new sample is taken into account if the new sample's volume is higher 
  than the old one).
+ Added - "pb help" function (i.e. You can write in the console "pb help add" 
  to see more info about "pb add" command. That function was missing since 
  the time SpLoRyGoN was coding podbot mm; he haven't had time to do it, 
  but he really wanted it.
+ FIXED - the code for cleaning unnecessary connections - it should take care 
  more about any waypoint with JUMP flag, so You shouldn't need to repeat Your
  jumps to save them again because the code was cleaning some jumps 
  connections, too.
+ Changed - the functionality of pb_latencybot cvar. Now when You set it to 2,
  it starts to show virtual random ping for bots (it gets random from 30-50 
  range value).
+ Added new function when the bot is falling down at least half a second, 
  it should press "use" button (to support parachute AMX/AMXX plugins). 
  It works only if sv_parachute cvar exists and it is set to 1.
+ Added - when the first player joins a Ts or CTs team on the server and there
  are bots only, the round is restarted in 1 second.
+ Removed the check for dead players if the user is with NOCLIP movement flag.
+ FIXED - the problem with radio commands - when the cvar pb_radio is 0, bots 
  should still react on radio messages (they just don't answer by radio).
+ FIXED - the problem with hostages staying above a bot (i.e. on a box), 
  the hostage wasn't "used" by a bot. That should also help with defusing 
  a bomb on a box.
+ FIXED - the problem with fast direction change when the bot is moving and 
  no enemy around (they should rotate now more smoothly).
+ FIXED - the problem with chat messages not filling the string with a name 
  of the player the message is related to.
+ FIXED - the problem with chat messages parsing players names with a space 
  (i.e. if the player had a name "James Bond" in the message string it was 
  only "James").
+ Changed the delay time bots would answer to chat messages (that should 
  prevent bots to overflood the chat area).
+ Changed the chat usage - the bots should chat less often (they shouldn't 
  spam the chat area).
+ FIXED - "shoot at death time" is working now as it should (when the bot kills
  an enemy, he is still trying to shoot at the same direction for a random 
  period - 0.3sec, 1.0sec).
+ FIXED - the problem with bots neverending trying to break some unbreakable 
  obstacle (after short time that unbreakable obstacle gets ignored by 
  a bot now).
+ FIXED other things concerning to shaking bots.
+ Changed time of displaying the message about PWF creator (12 seconds after 
  the new round is started after the player joined the server.
+ Changed time of displaying the welcome message (15 seconds after the new 
  round is started after the player joined the server.
+ Changed time of displaying the message about PWF creator (15 seconds after 
  the player joined the server and the round is started).
+ FIXED the problem with bots switching the weapon to the knife in the middle 
  of reloading the weapon.
+ FIXED the problem with bots sometimes not hearing the enemy even if he was 
  really close to them.
+ FIXED the problem with bots not trying to seek the cover while reloading 
  the weapon.
+ Changed the selection of task ENEMYHUNT and SEEKCOVER.
+ FIXED bug with pushing away bots on the edge of the roof - they shouldn't 
  fall down now.
+ FIXED bug with pushing away bots in smaller areas.
+ Cleaned the code (exactly some functions are splitted to let the coder 
  easier find a specific code).
+ FIXED bug with bots throwing nades in some random places.
+ FIXED bug with bots looking at the wall for longer time.
+ FIXED the problem with bots not trying to switch to secondary weapon in short
  distances (if they are using snipers i.e.).
+ FIXED the bug with bots not shooting to enemies farer away than 4096 units.
+ Reduced again bots shaking problem.
+ FIXED the bug with bots not overjumping obstacles while they are stuck.
+ FIXED the bug with bots jumping after spawning.
+ Changed - bots shouldn't camp if they have a shotgun or m241.
+ Added 1 new command (exactly old command with new argument) for 
  waypointers:
  pb wp teleport goal - teleports the waypointer to the next waypoint with 
     the flag GOAL.
+ Changed the default value of pb_dangerfactor from 800 to 2000 (it may
  affect the server performance on an older PC).
+ Changed - bots are buying weapons on an aim_xxx and awp_xxx maps 
  if info_map_parameters allows that.

V 3.0 metamod Build 22

+Added the code to prevent bots looking up or down for no reason.
+Added the new cvar - pb_firsthumanrestart (0 stops the function added in V3B21
  - when the first human joins the server and there are some bots already 
  playing there - the round is restarted). Now this function is off by default. 
  You can switch it to on by changing the value from 0 to 1.
+Added code to let the bot reload the weapon at round end (if the bot doesn't 
  see any enemy that time).
+FIXED - the vip bot shouldn't hunt the enemy anymore.
+FIXED max clip for tmp (now is 30 like it should be).
+Added code to prevent bots loose too much ammo while shooting at the wall (they 
  should fire at the wall less now).
+Changed - when the bomb is planted, CTs shouldn't be so much scarried now (so 
  they shouldn't overuse the task seekcover) - thus they are more hurry in 
  defusing the bomb.
+Added more info to the log file about saving (or not) pxp and pvi files.
+Added - bots are buying also the secondary weapon now (especially when they 
  have a sniper or a shield).
+FIXED bots are hunting the teamnate when he was attacking him - now the TA 
  revenge takes only 1.5 sec after TA (the bot gives some damage only instead 
  fire until kill the team attacker).
+FIXED team specific waypoint are now really team specific (before it was fixed
  for offensive and deffensive goals, now bots should really take care about 
  their team specific waypoints).
+FIXED planting and defusing the bomb problem (bots sometimes were stopping 
  to plant / defuse the bomb when they have seen an enemy, but they didn't 
  switch to better weapon to fire at the enemy).
+FIXED infinitely switching the weapon between the sniper and the pistol.
+FIXED chicken and zombie bots camping (now they will no longer camp - except 
  they need to hide because of low health).
+FIXED invisibility not working for an invisible player using a knife.
+FIXED problem reported by mhanor (bots with the skill lower than 100 shouldn't
  infinitively get their crosshair to the hell when the enemy is no longer 
  visible). That should help a bit also with bots looking up and shooting into 
  the sky. 
+FIXED another bug with bots looking at the sky for no reason.
+FIXED problem with a bot shaking when its enemy is hiding behind an obstacle.
+FIXED problem with bot getting stuck with each other (because of wrong 
  initialisation of model (thanks to IMMORTAL_BLG).
+FIXED bug with executing task spraying logo while debuggoal index has been set
  to something different than -1 (bots should get that WP as its goal 
  - spraying logo task wasn't working in that case).
+FIXED problem with breakable - bots sometimes didn't break the breakable 
  obstacle in its path (the code to unstuck was starting too early in some 
  cases - before checking if there is a breakable blocking the way of the bot).
+FIXED bug with bots spraying ammo too much at the wall/obstacle (now they do 
  it much less).
+FIXED bug with bots looking at the sky while planting the bomb.
+FIXED bug concerning to bots buying nightgogles if it's unnessesary.
+IMPROVED bots aiming at moving targets.
+FIXED bug with bots not switching to the "normal" weapon while planting 
  the bomb when they can see the enemy (to do - exclude the situation if 
  the best bot's weapon is a knife - i.e. if the clip of primary or secondary 
  weapon is empty - switching to the knife while planting the bomb helps 
  nothing).
+FIXED bug with bots looking sometimes in stupid directions (i.e. at the wall 
  instead at any open surface) while camping after planting the bomb or camping
  at other WP without a camp flag. Now they should choose a better camping 
  direction in such situations.
+FIXED bug with "meta unload" function (thanks to IMMORTAL_BLG).
+FIXED problem with not working darkness checking by bots on linux servers
  (thanks to IMMORTAL_BLG). Now - because of the new code - bots are using 
  flashlights (and also nvg) also on linux servers.
