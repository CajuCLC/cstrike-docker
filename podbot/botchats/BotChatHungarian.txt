# Start of the "dynamic" replies from here
# After each @KEY Tag you need to specify the

# have several keywords (aliases) each separated by a comma.
# After the keywords line, the answers or messages to this
# special keyword need to be given. In theory there can be an unlimited
# number of answers of course you should care about the used memory ;)    

[REPLIES]

@KEY " AGAIN "
%s, things are always repeating - aren't they?
And I'm sure it wasn't the last time...
That's the way things go, hey...

@KEY "AIMBOT", "WALLHACK"
%s, are you cheating ?
Even PunkBuster fails to detect some of them...
You can't be sure nowadays if someones's good at playing or cheats
Aimbots are cool, shut up %s!
Wallhacks are evil tools of the devil ;)

@KEY " ALWAYS "
That's not always, %s!
I just like it :-)
Come on %s, that was only the second time!

@KEY "ANDROID"
Ah yes, those were the times...
%s was it your first Bot too ?
Does anybody know what DaTa does today ?
You can't play with Android on %m, can you ?

@KEY "BOTMAN"
Who is this botman everybody is talking about???
Visit his website at http://www.planethalflife.com/botman
Whithout his sourcecode many bots wouldn't exist!
I wonder when HPB-Bot will be finished...
Did you play his HPB-Bot yet ?

@KEY " BOT ", "BOTS"
Why are you always talking about them?
There are no bots on this server %s, I tell you!
Bots are cool!!!
What's your favourite bot, %s?
If you want to program your own, ask botman!
Bots, all the time bots - you should start playing with humans.
Most bots are still very stupid!

@KEY "CAMPER", "CAMPING"
I really hate those campers!
Camping sucks!
Don't you camp sometimes %s ?
Camping's often the only option to win...
Yes, good 'ole Camper-Strike...

@KEY "CHEAT"
Those damn cheaters are ruining the entire game!
I suspect that %f is cheating
I hate cheaters!
Cheating sucks!
Why are so many people cheating?
Punkbuster could help...
Play with bots - they don't cheat!

@KEY " CLAN "
What are these clans all about?
I was in a clan once, but it sucked hard.
What clan are you from, %s?
Do you want to enter our clan, %s?
Playing in a clan is for people who got no life...

@KEY " CS ", "COUNTERSTRIKE", "COUNTER-STRIKE", "CSTRIKE"
Counter-Strike is boring nowadays...
%s how long do you play CS ?
CS all the way from the very first beta!
There are too much newbies playing it.
Too many people online cheat in CS
It's not as much fun as it used to be

@KEY " DOD ", "DAY OF DEFEAT"
I don't get what people like in DoD
CS all the way...
%s do you think it will get as popular as CS ?
%s do you prefer DoD over CS ?
Day of Defeat is a hopeless MOD, IMHO.

@KEY " ENGINE "
I heard the HL Engine is a hybrid between Quake1 & Quake2, odd huh?
%s, don't you miss the time when an engine was a Software Engine ?
The HL Engine is still quite good, despite its age...
Code your own engine %s !

@KEY "FUCK", "DAMN", "PISS"
Don't swear, %s!
Nasty %s!
Yes, you're right, %s. Now SHUT UP!
Watch your language, %s!

And I think you should shut up and play!
And you really do believe that, %s?
What makes you think so?
Plz give me your ICQ Number %s

@KEY "JOEBOT"
Yes, JoeBot isn't bad...
Funnily JoeBot got famous when NNBot quit...
I wonder where else Neural Networks could be applied
So you think JoeBot rocks ?

@KEY "JUMBOT"
JB ? It was good back then but ParaBot is much better now!
JB's advantage has been that it was a MOD, not a hooking DLL
Ah yes, Jumbot and The Fatal. Wonder what he's up to now.
Rumours have it that The Fatal now does AHL Bots ? 

@KEY " MUSIC ", " BAND "
Umm...I don't care as long as it's no commercial shit
Underground Electro Polka is the real deal!
Do you still use Napster %s ?
Somebody got good MP3 Links ?

@KEY "NNBOT"
Too bad NNBot is discontinued...
Try JoeBot if you liked NNBot %s
%s did you hear of Ditlew's new MOD ?

@KEY "PARABOT"
ParaBot is a the coolest Deathmatch Bot I've ever played
%s you should try ParaBot, it's great!
It's so sad no CSBot has the great Nav of Parabot so far
I heard it already supports 3 HL MODS by now

@KEY " PING ", "LAGG"
I always have a Ping of 5, I'm on DSL !!
My connection sucks...
Where are you from %s ?
Play offline with Bots if your connection sucks
Just change your provider %s!

I heard it's the best Bot for CS, I'm not sure though...

Q3 has a bad lighting IMO
Half-Life still rules %s!
Have you heard of DMC, %s? ;-)

@KEY "REALBOT"
Is it any good %s?
Is RB still unwaypointed %s ?
Yep, I remember RB. First unwaypointed Bot right ?
I heard RB now tries to do something like ParaBot ?!?
Once lovingly called 'the wallhuggers'

@KEY "SCRIPT"
Scripts are for losers
%s, you prolly don't know how to bind keys ?
Did you know that even buying scripts are considered cheating ?

@KEY "SERVER"
I'm always on this Server
Me & my friends play a lot on this Server
I believe this Server's got a good Map Rotation

@KEY "SORRY"
Yeah, afterwards everybody says he's sorry!
The excuse doesn't help me now, %s!
Next time you better think before you start doing something, %s!
I'm sorry, too!
You don't know how sorry you will be for doing that...

@KEY "TEAMKILL", " TK "
Teamkillers should be banned from this server.

The answer is out there, %s ;-)
No idea, %s
Dunno.
What do you think %s?
I won't tell you, %s!
Find out yourself, %s!
Good question, %s!

[UNKNOWN]
Bla bla bla...
What did you say, %s?
Concentrate on the game, %s!
Chatting with you %s is so great!
These damn chat-messages are freaking me out!
Don't spam, %s!
How do you find the time to type all this crap???
Yeah, %s. You're right!
No way, %s...
